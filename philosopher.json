    "name": "Ludwig Wittgenstein",
    "born": 1889,
    "died": 1951,
    "livedIn": "Austria",
    "books": "On Certainty, Philosophical Investigations",
    "summary": "Born in Austria to a wealthy family, Wittgenstein is one of philosophyâ€™s more colorful and unusual characters. He lived a life of eccentricity and professional nomadism, dabbling in academia, military service, education, and even as a hospital orderly. Moreover, during his life, he wrote voluminously but published only a single manuscript. And yet, he was recognized by his contemporaries as a genius. The posthumous publication of his many volumes confirmed this view for future generations, ultimately rendering Wittgenstein a towering figure in the areas of logic, semantics, and the philosophy of mind. His investigations of linguistics and psychology would prove particularly revelatory, offering a distinctive window through which to newly understand the nature of meaning and the limits of human conception."
